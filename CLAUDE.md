# CLAUDE.md - AudioSilo Sidecars

Guidance for working in this repository. Keep this file updated as the codebase
evolves. This is the seventh repo in the AudioSilo workspace (`~/dev/audiosilo`) -
read the workspace [CLAUDE.md](../CLAUDE.md) first, plus
[audiosilo-meta/CLAUDE.md](../audiosilo-meta/CLAUDE.md) (the upstream metadata
database this tool contributes to) and its EXTRACTION.md / EXTRACTION-AUDIO.md
(the pipeline this tool automates).

## What this is

A standalone **contributor tool**: point it at an audiobook folder and it turns
that book into the community **characters/recaps sidecars** for
[meta.audiosilo.app](https://meta.audiosilo.app) - folder scan -> coverage check
-> ASR -> an agent pipeline (fact pass -> notes-only synthesis -> adversarial
spoiler audit) -> validated CC BY-SA sidecars -> a contribution (intake issue /
PR / keep-local). It packages the previously hand-run
`claude -p` / EXTRACTION-AUDIO.md process behind a Go daemon + embedded web UI so
anyone can help, with Claude or ChatGPT backends and subscription or API-key
auth. The design basis is the workspace plan (Context / Architecture /
Milestones).

It is a **client tool, not a server**: it reads the public meta.audiosilo.app API
(coverage/lookup, no auth) and produces PRs/issues. It never receives writes and
holds no community data of its own.

Module path: `github.com/kodestar/audiosilo-sidecars`. Code is **AGPL-3.0**
(matching audiosilo-server/meta). The sidecars it produces are CC BY-SA 3.0 (the
meta repo's content license) - never fabricated, own-words only; the copyright
rules in audiosilo-meta's AUTHORING.md / LICENSING.md are load-bearing for the
pipeline milestones.

## Model routing (every session follows this)

Sessions in this repo run a fixed division of labour between models:

- **Fable (the main session) is the orchestrator only.** It owns task
  decomposition, orchestration, design taste/direction, and final QA of every
  delegated piece. It **never writes feature code directly** - it reviews diffs,
  runs the gate, and sends work back when it falls short. Runs at **high** effort
  (do not escalate to xhigh/max). It may write orchestration artifacts itself:
  this file, briefs, commit messages.
- **Opus subagents do the implementation.** One subagent per task
  (`model: "opus"`); parallel when tasks touch disjoint files, sequential when
  one depends on another's output. Each subagent gets a self-contained brief
  (files, constraints, acceptance criteria) and must leave the gate green for
  the code it touched.
- **Token-hungry chores go to cheaper models** (Sonnet/Haiku): bulk codebase
  analysis/inventories, screenshot sweeps, log triage. They report findings back;
  they don't make design decisions.

## Build / test / gate

```sh
# Go side (from repo root) - the default build embeds a UI placeholder, so it
# needs NO Node toolchain and no generated files.
go build ./... && go vet ./... && go test -race ./... && golangci-lint run

# Frontend side (from web/) - Node 24 (export PATH="$HOME/.nvm/versions/node/v24.16.0/bin:$PATH")
cd web && npx tsc --noEmit && npm run lint && npm run format && npm test

# Real-UI binary (embeds the built SPA via -tags embedui):
scripts/build-web.sh          # builds web/, syncs into internal/web/dist, builds bin/
./bin/audiosilo-sidecars serve # first run prints the one-time admin password ONCE
```

**Before a change is done, run all of the above for the side(s) you touched.**
golangci-lint is **v2** at a **green baseline** - fix new findings, don't widen
excludes (matches the server/meta repos' policy). Go 1.25; Node 24.

> Before adding code, read the workspace **[CODE-HEALTH.md](../CODE-HEALTH.md)** -
> Definition of Done + the recurring drift patterns. Especially: keep business
> logic out of the transport layer (`internal/api` is transport-only); every
> feature ships a test; security-critical code needs an allowed AND a denied test.

### Web build embedding (the `-tags embedui` seam)

`go:embed` cannot reach the repo-root `web/dist`, so the embed target is selected
by a build tag:

- **Default build (no tags)** embeds `internal/web/dist-placeholder/` (a tiny
  "run scripts/build-web.sh" page). This keeps `go build ./...` green on a fresh
  clone with no Node. The API is fully functional; only the UI is a placeholder.
- **`-tags embedui`** embeds `internal/web/dist/` (gitignored), which
  `scripts/build-web.sh` populates from the real `web/dist` build. This is the
  production/Docker binary.

This mirrors audiosilo-server's `-tags embedplayer`. Do not commit
`internal/web/dist/`; only the placeholder is tracked.

## Package layout

```
cmd/audiosilo-sidecars/   entrypoint: `serve` (default) + `version`; flags --data, --listen
internal/
  config/   config.yaml in <data>/ + AUDIOSILO_SIDECARS_* env overrides; Load/Save/Validate;
            asr + agent sections are typed stubs consumed by later milestones
  auth/     single admin password (argon2id, generated + printed once on first run),
            opaque SHA-256-hashed session tokens, a per-IP login rate limiter; the
            Store interface is storage-agnostic (JSON file store today, SQLite in M1)
  secrets/  named secrets (anthropic/openai keys, github PAT) in the OS keychain
            (go-keyring) with a 0600 secrets.json fallback; read API is presence-only
  events/   SSE hub: Publish -> monotonic-id fan-out, ring-buffer replay from
            Last-Event-ID, ephemeral heartbeats, slow-subscriber eviction
  api/      transport-only HTTP: auth/system/settings/events handlers + middleware
            (bearer auth, allow-list CORS, security headers). NO business logic here.
  web/      go:embed of the SPA (build-tag selected) + SPA-fallback static serving
  server/   http.Server wiring, graceful shutdown, the startup banner
web/          the SPA: Vite + React 19 + TS + Tailwind v4 (npm, Node 24); dist/ is embedded
scripts/build-web.sh   build the SPA + embed it into bin/ (-tags embedui)
Dockerfile             multi-stage: node build -> go build (embedui) -> distroless
```

**Dependency direction** (transport-only rule): `server -> {api, auth, secrets,
events, config, web}`; `api -> {auth, secrets, events, config}`. Handlers marshal
DTOs and call into the injected packages; they hold no logic.

## Conventions

- **`internal/api` is transport-only.** Handlers validate/route and call into
  `auth`/`secrets`/`config`/`events`. Keep logic in those packages so it stays
  unit-testable. Same rule as audiosilo-server/manager.
- **Every feature ships with a test.** Security-critical paths (auth resolve,
  rate limiter, CORS allow-list, settings-never-echo-secrets) require **both an
  allowed and a denied** test.
- **Secrets are never logged or echoed.** The one-time admin password is printed
  once in the first-run banner and never again; session tokens and API keys are
  stored only as hashes / in the keychain; the settings read API returns presence
  booleans, never values. Secrets never enter config.yaml.
- **Loopback by default.** `--listen` defaults to `127.0.0.1:8090`; auth is
  always on. A separately-deployed UI reaches the daemon cross-origin only via an
  explicit `cors_origins` allow-list.
- **Facts only in the pipeline (later milestones).** Sidecars are own-words,
  spoiler-gated, and verifiable; source audio/transcripts never enter this repo -
  only the derived CC BY-SA sidecars leave it. Follow audiosilo-meta's
  AUTHORING.md / EXTRACTION-AUDIO.md.
- **Hyphens, never em dashes** (workspace-wide rule), in docs, comments, UI copy,
  and generated text alike.

## Status / roadmap

Milestones from the workspace plan; each is shippable.

- **M0 (done):** repo skeleton, config, auth (first-run password + sessions +
  rate limit), secrets (keychain + 0600 fallback), the SSE event hub, the
  transport-only API, the embedded 4-tab web UI shell (Library/Running/Done are
  placeholders; Settings is real - password change + write-only secrets), and the
  Dockerfile stub. **Gate:** login local + remote-with-auth; SSE heartbeat visible
  in the UI liveness dot.
- **M1 (planned):** SQLite store, the per-book state machine + scheduler (stub
  executors), `pkg/scan` (folder identification) + the coverage/lookup client, and
  the Library tab end to end.
- **M2-M8 (planned):** toolfetch + audio (ffmpeg split), ASR backends
  (mlx-whisper + whisper.cpp), QA/spelling ports, the agent runner (claude +
  codex) with staged context dirs enforcing the invariants, the fact-pass +
  synthesis + audit loop, contribution (intake/PR/local), and packaging
  (GoReleaser + Docker matrix). See the plan for the full table.

Everything past M0 is **not built yet** - the config `asr`/`agent` sections,
the extra tabs, and the pipeline packages are stubs or absent. Keep this file
honest as milestones land.
